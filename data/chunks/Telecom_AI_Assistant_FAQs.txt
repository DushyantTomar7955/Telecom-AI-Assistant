Telecom AI Assistant Frequently Asked Questions1. What is a Telecom AI Assistant?A Telecom AI Assistant is a virtual system that helps telecom engineers or customers retrieve informationfrom telecom documents using natural language queries.2. What are common issues faced by telecom engineers at sites?Common issues include signal interference, equipment malfunction, fiber cuts, configuration errors, andpower failures.3

.3. What is Blown Fiber Optics?It is an alternate fiber optic cable installation method using highpressure air to blow fiber cables throughMicroDucts in limitedaccess areas.4. How does the AI assistant retrieve answers?The assistant uses document embeddings and vector search e.g., FAISS to find the most relevant chunksfrom a knowledge base, then generates an answer.5. Can the AI assistant work offline?Yes, if you use a local language model like TinyLLaMA and a local vector DB like FAISS or Chroma.6

.6. What is the difference between singlemode and multimode fiber?Singlemode fiber supports longdistance transmission with a single light path, while multimode fiber supportsshorter distances with multiple light paths.7. What should I do if the assistant gives a wrong answer? Telecom AI Assistant Frequently Asked QuestionsEnsure the context document contains the relevant information. If not, the assistant should reply with I dontknow based on the provided data.8

.8. What is a MicroDuct in fiber installations?A MicroDuct is a small, flexible conduit used to protect and guide blown fiber cables.9. What is PON in optical networking?PON stands for Passive Optical Network, which is a pointtomultipoint fiber network with no activecomponents in the signal path.10. What documents can be used in the AI assistant?Technical manuals, telecom standards, SOPs, and infrastructure guidelines in PDF or text format arecommonly used.11

.11. What model is best for 4GB RAM laptops?TinyLLaMA1.1B or DistilBERTbased models are lightweight and suitable for lowresource devices.12. How to handle proprietary OEM limitations in fiber installations?Ensure to get OEM approval during the design phase to avoid vendor lockin issues.13. How is context used in RAG models?The assistant retrieves relevant paragraphs based on vector similarity to the users question and uses themto generate an answer. Telecom AI Assistant Frequently Asked Questions14

. What is FAISS used for?FAISS is a vector database used to perform fast similarity searches on document embeddings for questionanswering.15. How to test if AI assistant gives correct answers?Use a benchmark set of FAQs and compare AI outputs against known correct answers from the documents.16. Can the assistant summarize documents?Yes, if programmed to do so, the assistant can summarize long documents or sections using LLMcapabilities.17

.17. Is LangChain necessary for RAG pipeline?Not strictly, but LangChain simplifies handling chains like retrieval generation prompt templates.18. What is a TR in telecom infrastructure?TR stands for Telecommunications Room a secure room for housing network equipment and terminationpoints.19. How does blown fiber installation differ from traditional pulling?Blown fiber is more flexible for future upgrades, while traditional pulling may require more manual labor anddisruption.20

.20. What should be shown in riser diagrams for fiber planning?TR locations, MicroDuct paths, floor entry points, fiber types and strand counts, and any divergence paths.
